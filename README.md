SUPERCRIMP is an existing, small, local business that sells 3D-printed crimp holds for rock-climbing enthusiasts.

At the time of starting this project, the business hadn’t been able to find an appropriate website to host its online store, with some e-commerce platforms falling short of features and others being too complicated or expensive for a simple business.

Thus, the goal of this project was to build a customised online store that meets the needs of SUPERCRIMP’s stakeholders:

**For customers**

- It must be convenient to browse and make purchases.
- They must be able to pay securely online.

**For the business owner**

- It must be easy to view order details and mark them as complete.
- It must be easy to add, update and delete product listings.
